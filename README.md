Data Science Kaggle Challenge on Personal Injury Accidents

Context
For each personal injury accident (i.e. an accident occurring on a road open to public traffic, involving at least one vehicle and resulting in at least one victim requiring treatment), information describing the accident is entered by the police unit that intervened at the accident site. These entries are collected in the national road traffic injury file.

The present database lists all traffic accidents that occurred during a given year in metropolitan France and the overseas departments (Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Reunion Island and Mayotte) with a simplified description. This includes information on the location of the accident, such as information on the characteristics of the accident and its location, the vehicles involved and their victims.

Dataset
The dataset contains thousands of individuals and 32 variables (which are either quantitative or categorical) with many missing values. The description of these variables is available in the file description.txt.

The target variable is the severity of each personal injury accident. It is a label taking 4 values:

Unscathed
Slight injury
Injured in hospital
Killed
Goal
The goal of this challenge is to predict the severity of a personal injury accident based on 31 descriptive variables.
